If your workflow involves opening a lot of tabs and lot of windows in your web browser, be it for referencing multiple sources, checking various websites. Then you would have been facing problems in switching between tabs.

# What this extension does?

- Allows to switch between tabs in your chrome-browser like your favourite text-editor or IDE.

- It will load all the active opened tabs as a list (even the one is running in background) and you can search from the list and go to your desired tabs.


Download the extension from [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-switcher/akenkgmojelifdnoogjnjfegmegandil?hl=en-US&gl=IN)
